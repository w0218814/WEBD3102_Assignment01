# My Application Documentation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my application. This document provides a brief overview of the technology used, the structure of the application, how to set up the database connection, and the conclusion of what we've achieved with this application.

## Technology Used

The application is built using J2EE, ideal for creating large-scale applications. Here's a breakdown of the key technologies:

- **Servlets**: Handle incoming and outgoing web requests, ensuring our app can process user interactions efficiently.
- **JavaServer Pages (JSP)**: Allow for the addition of interactive elements to web pages by combining Java and HTML, enhancing user engagement.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Facilitates communication with a database (e.g., MySQL) for operations like adding, removing, or modifying information.
- **GlassFish**: Serves as the application server, managing the technical aspects to ensure smooth operation.

## How the Files Fit Together

- **Header.jsp**: Contains common web page elements for consistent presentation.
- **AdminConsole.jsp**: Admin interface for user and task management.
- **AdminRegistration.jsp**: Allows admins to modify user information.
- **Registration.jsp**: New user registration form.
- **Login.jsp**: User login page.
- **Todo-Form.jsp**: Task addition or update form.
- **Todo-List.jsp**: Displays tasks with options for details, editing, and deletion.
- **Glassfish-web.xml**: Configures the GlassFish server, including database connections.
- **Index.jsp**: Redirects to the login page to ensure user authentication.
- **LoginServlet.java**: Manages the login process and user redirection.
- **AdminServlet.java**: Admin console access control.
- **User.java / UserServlet.java**: Manages user data interactions.
- **Todo.java / TodoServlet.java**: Manages task data interactions.
- **TodoDAO.java**: Executes SQL queries on the `todos` table.
- **UserDAO.java**: Executes SQL queries on the `user` table.

## Setting Up the Database Connection

The application's database connection is meticulously configured through GlassFish, ensuring reliable database interaction. The configuration includes specifying database names, types, and login credentials, all managed within the `Glassfish-web.xml` file.

## Conclusion

Combining Servlets, JSPs, JDBC, and GlassFish, the application offers a user-friendly platform for managing tasks, with robust features for user registration, login, and task management. The careful database connection setup ensures smooth operation, aligning with our goals for a reliable, secure, and scalable application.
